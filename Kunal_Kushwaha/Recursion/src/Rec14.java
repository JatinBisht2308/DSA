// Rope cutting problem : We have n as the length of the rope and a,b and c are the possible length of the piece
// we have to cut the rope in the maximum number of pieces for eg:-
// n=5, a=2, b=5, c=1  Answer -> 5(5 piece of length 1 i.e c)
// n=23, a=12, b=9, c=11 Answer -> 2(12 and 11) that means there is only one way to cut the rope that is 12 and 11 will be 2 part
// n=5, a=4, b=2, c=6 Answer -> -1 (no two piece can be selected to make the sum as 5) here we can not cut this rope.
